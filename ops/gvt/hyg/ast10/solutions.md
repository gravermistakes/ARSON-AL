## AgentMint

**Description:** Runtime enforcement and signed evidence for AI agent tool calls. Evaluates every tool call against a human-approved scope before execution. Produces cryptographically signed, hash-chained receipts for every decision (allow or deny).

**License:** MIT  
**Repository:** [https://github.com/aniketh-maddipati/agentmint-python](https://github.com/aniketh-maddipati/agentmint-python)  
**Install:** `pip install agentmint`  
**Dependencies:** 2 (pynacl, requests)

### AST Risks Addressed

**AST01 — Malicious Skills:** Ed25519 signatures and SHA-256 hash chains on every receipt provide tamper-evident audit trails. Evidence packages are independently verifiable without vendor software.

**AST02 — Supply Chain Compromise:** Signed plans include key ID for provenance tracking. Receipt chains with optional RFC 3161 timestamps support independent verification of action history.

**AST03 — Over-Privileged Skills:** Runtime scope enforcement using pattern matching with wildcard hierarchies. Actions outside the approved scope are blocked before execution. Checkpoint mechanism requires human re-approval for sensitive actions.

**AST04 — Insecure Metadata:** Plan metadata (scope, delegates, checkpoints, expiry) is covered by Ed25519 signature. Modifying any field invalidates the plan.

**AST07 — Update Drift:** Plans have TTL-based expiry. Policy version is captured in every receipt via a policy hash (SHA-256 of canonical scope, checkpoints, and delegates).

**AST08 — Poor Scanning:** Shield module scans tool inputs for prompt injection (23 pattern categories), PII, secrets, encoding evasion, and structural injection. Pattern-based only; does not perform semantic analysis.

**AST09 — No Governance:** Per-agent session tracking with configurable escalation thresholds. Circuit breaker rate limiting prevents runaway execution. Signed audit trail links every action to a human-approved plan.

### Risks Not Addressed

**AST04 — Insecure Metadata (deserialization):** Does not parse skill manifests or configs from untrusted sources.  
**AST06 — Weak Isolation:** Runs in-process. Does not provide containerization or sandbox isolation.  
**AST10 — Cross-Platform Reuse:** Receipt format is tool-specific; does not yet implement the Universal Skill Format.

### Known Limitations

- Scanning is regex-based. Semantic and behavioral attacks are not detected.
- Runs in-process alongside the agent. A compromised process can bypass enforcement.
- No web dashboard or UI. Designed as a library, not a platform.

### Framework Integration

Integrates via hooks with CrewAI, OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, and MCP. Typical integration requires approximately 20 lines of code per framework.

## Nobulex

**Description:** Cryptographic receipt layer for AI agent actions. Produces Ed25519-signed, JCS-canonical (RFC 8785) bilateral receipts — a pre-execution admission record and a post-execution outcome record — linked by a content-derived `action_ref = SHA-256(JCS({agent_id, action_type, scope, timestamp_ms}))`. Receipts are independently verifiable against the issuer's public key without operator cooperation.

**License:** MIT  
**Repository:** [https://github.com/arian-gogani/nobulex](https://github.com/arian-gogani/nobulex)  
**Install:** `pip install nobulex` (Python) or `npm install @nobulex/core` (TypeScript)  
**Dependencies:** Python — `cryptography`, `rfc8785`. TypeScript — `@noble/ed25519`, `canonicalize`.

### AST Risks Addressed

**AST03 — Over-Privileged Skills:** Each receipt binds the action to the `scope` field at decision time. A scope mismatch between the admission receipt (what was authorized) and the outcome receipt (what executed) produces non-matching `action_ref` hashes, detectable without trusting the runtime. The denied-before-dispatch path is first-class: a DENY decision produces an admission receipt; absence of an outcome receipt with that `attempt_id` proves the action was blocked rather than silently dropped.

**AST04 — Insecure Metadata:** The signed bilateral receipt covers `agent_id`, `action_type`, `scope`, `policy_version`, and `timestamp_ms` under one Ed25519 signature. Modifying any field invalidates the signature; the canonical preimage is recomputable from the receipt fields by any third party.

**AST07 — Update Drift:** `policy_version` is bound at decision time inside the admission receipt. A policy change between admission and execution is detectable because the receipt records the version that authorized the action, not the version in effect at audit time.

**AST09 — No Governance:** Hash-chained receipts produce a tamper-evident audit trail where each receipt references the prior receipt's digest. The chain is exportable as a structured package and verifiable offline against the agent's published Ed25519 public key — directly supporting the operator-independent verification property that EU AI Act Article 12 (enforcement August 2, 2026) requires.

### Risks Not Addressed

**AST01 — Malicious Skills:** Out of scope — does not scan, classify, or analyze skill code or intent. Pair with a scanner (e.g., SkillSpector) for pre-install detection.  
**AST02 — Supply Chain Compromise:** Out of scope — does not verify upstream provenance of the skill itself, only records the actions a skill takes once running.  
**AST05 — Untrusted External Instructions:** Out of scope — does not inspect or sandbox external content fetched at runtime.  
**AST06 — Weak Isolation:** Out of scope — provides no runtime sandboxing or process isolation. A compromised agent process can choose not to emit receipts; the audit trail then shows absence, not a forged execution.  
**AST08 — Poor Scanning:** Out of scope — not a scanner.  
**AST10 — Cross-Platform Reuse:** Partial — receipts are framework-agnostic at the field level (the receipt format is plain JSON + Ed25519), but the receipt records skill *calls*, not skill *definitions*, so it does not contribute to a Universal Skill Format.

### Known Limitations

- Receipts prove what the agent *self-reported* about its actions. A compromised agent can refuse to emit receipts; absence in the chain is detectable but does not by itself prove what the agent actually did externally. Pair with isolation (AST06) for runtime enforcement.
- Receipt verification is per-record. Set completeness (proving no receipts were dropped between two known ones) requires additional sequence-number and lifecycle fields not present in the current 4-field preimage. Verifiers checking contiguity need to pin the scope themselves.
- No on-chain anchoring in the core SDK. Long-horizon non-repudiation requires composition with a separate timestamping layer (RFC 3161 TSA, on-chain anchor, or transparency log).

### Framework Integration

Wraps any tool-call boundary: pre-execution admission emit + post-execution outcome emit. Integration examples shipped for LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and direct MCP tool wrappers. Typical integration is one decorator or middleware function per agent. Benchmark: ~13,700 receipts/second on a 2024 M-series laptop, single-process (reproducible via `benchmarks/bench.ts` in the repo).

## SkilLock

**Description:** Behavior-layer lockfile and capability-delta PR review for AI agent skills. Statically parses each skill's `SKILL.md` fenced bash blocks and bundled scripts to record the *observed* capability surface (shell, network, file reads/writes, tool grants, scripts) into a committed `skills.lock` file, then blocks unapproved drift in CI and shows the capability delta in every pull request.

**License:** Apache-2.0 (the `SPEC.md` interop spec is CC BY 4.0)  
**Repository:** [https://github.com/skills-lock/skil-lock](https://github.com/skills-lock/skil-lock)  
**Install:** `go install github.com/skills-lock/skil-lock/cmd/skil-lock@latest` (also `brew install skills-lock/tap/skil-lock`, or download a SHA-256-checksummed release binary)  
**Dependencies:** Go 1.22+ at build time; ships as a single static binary with no runtime dependencies (cobra, goldmark, yaml.v3 build-time only)

### AST Risks Addressed

**AST03 — Over-Privileged Skills:** Records the observed capability surface (shell commands, network URLs, file reads/writes, tool grants) parsed from `SKILL.md` and bundled scripts, independent of what the frontmatter declares. Per SkilLock's own [scan of 17,065 public skills](https://github.com/skills-lock/skil-lock/blob/main/docs/ecosystem-scan-2026-06.md), 38.8% executed shell but only 4.0% declared it; the `SKL-SHELL` / `SKL-NETWORK` / `SKL-TOOLS` detectors surface that declared-versus-observed gap so reviewers can right-size permissions.

**AST04 — Insecure Metadata:** The core check is manifest-versus-behavior mismatch — capabilities a skill actually exercises but does not declare in its `allowed-tools` / frontmatter are flagged in the PR, making under-declared or misleading metadata visible at review time rather than at runtime.

**AST07 — Update Drift:** The committed `skills.lock` pins the approved behavior surface; on every change SkilLock computes a capability delta against that baseline and fails the CI gate when a skill's observed behavior drifts from what was last approved. A PR-scoped override file records explicit, auditable approvals. This is the tool's primary function.

**AST08 — Poor Scanning:** Six deterministic detectors (`SKL-SHELL`, `SKL-NETWORK`, `SKL-FILE-READ`, `SKL-FILE-WRITE`, `SKL-TOOLS`, `SKL-SCRIPTS`) parse fenced bash blocks and bundled scripts to extract the behavior surface. Detection is deterministic and parse-based — no semantic or LLM analysis — so results are reproducible in CI, with the coverage limits that implies (see Known Limitations).

**AST09 — No Governance:** `skills.lock` is a committed, human-readable inventory of every skill's approved capability surface. The GitHub Action posts a per-PR capability-delta comment and emits SARIF v2.1.0 to GitHub Code Scanning, providing an auditable approval trail and a queryable inventory kept in version control.

**AST10 — Cross-Platform Reuse:** Parses the shared `SKILL.md` content layer used by both Claude Code and Codex, evaluating skill behavior independently of the runtime. It validates the existing shared format across the two supported platforms rather than defining a new universal format (see Known Limitations).

### Risks Not Addressed

**AST01 — Malicious Skills:** Partial. Capability-delta detection flags a previously-approved skill that gains dangerous behavior (new shell / network / exfiltration surface) in an update, but SkilLock performs no first-party malware or intent classification (no signatures or heuristics) and cannot judge a never-seen skill as malicious on first sight.  
**AST02 — Supply Chain Compromise:** Partial. Per-file content digests of bundled scripts detect tampered or newly-added scripts on update; SkilLock does not verify registry provenance or upstream signatures of the skill source itself.  
**AST05 — Untrusted External Instructions:** Partial. The `SKL-NETWORK` detector inventories the external hosts and URLs a skill references — useful for spotting and tracking external sources — but SkilLock does not pin, hash-verify, or sandbox the content fetched from them. (The deserialization concern, now folded into AST04, is likewise out of scope: frontmatter is parsed with a safe YAML library, but SkilLock does not analyze or sandbox deserialization the skills themselves perform.)  
**AST06 — Weak Isolation:** Not addressed. SkilLock is a post-install, CI-time review tool and provides no runtime sandboxing or process isolation (a runtime guard is explicitly out of scope for v1).

### Known Limitations

- Behavior is extracted by static parsing of fenced bash and bundled scripts; dynamically constructed commands, heavy obfuscation, or capabilities exercised only at runtime can evade it. Use it as a review-layer gate, not a sandbox.
- Deterministic detectors only — no semantic or LLM intent analysis. Pair with a pre-install scanner (AST01 / AST08) and runtime isolation (AST06).
- It detects *change* against an approved baseline; the strength of the gate depends on that baseline being reviewed carefully when first locked.

### Framework Integration

CLI (`scan`, `lock`, `init --baseline`, `diff`, `verify`, `ci`) plus a GitHub Action that posts the capability delta as a PR comment and uploads SARIF v2.1.0 to GitHub Code Scanning. Supports Claude Code and Codex skills (same `SKILL.md` format). Runs on ubuntu and macos GitHub-hosted runners (amd64 + arm64).

## SkillSpector

**Description:** Open-source security scanner for AI agent skills (NVIDIA). Performs two-stage analysis — fast static checks plus optional LLM semantic evaluation — to answer "is this skill safe to install?" before installation. Produces a 0–100 risk score with severity labels and SARIF, JSON, or Markdown reports.

**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Repository:** [https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillSpector](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillSpector)  
**Install:** `git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillSpector && make install` (or run via the included Dockerfile)  
**Dependencies:** Python 3.12+; optional LLM provider (Anthropic / OpenAI-compatible) for semantic analysis; OSV.dev for live CVE lookups

### AST Risks Addressed

**AST01 — Malicious Skills:** Detects malicious patterns and likely-malicious intent via YARA signatures, rogue-agent and trigger-abuse heuristics, and optional LLM intent analysis. Per NVIDIA's SkillSpector project, roughly 5.2% of scanned skills show likely malicious intent.

**AST02 — Supply Chain Compromise:** Supply-chain pattern category plus live OSV.dev CVE lookups against declared dependencies (with offline fallback).

**AST03 — Over-Privileged Skills:** Flags excessive agency, privilege escalation, tool misuse, and MCP least-privilege violations.

**AST04 — Insecure Metadata:** Scans `SKILL.md` prose and metadata for prompt injection and system-prompt leakage.

**AST08 — Poor Scanning:** Directly addresses the scanning gap — combines static analysis (AST-based dangerous-code detection, taint tracking, YARA) across both the code and natural-language layers with optional LLM semantic evaluation, covering 64 patterns across 16 categories.

**AST09 — No Governance:** Emits SARIF v2.1.0 for GitHub Code Scanning and CI gates; the 0–100 risk score supports approval workflows and scan-result inventories.

**AST10 — Cross-Platform Reuse:** Platform-agnostic content-layer scanner (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI) that evaluates skills independently of the runtime.

### Risks Not Addressed

**AST04 — Insecure Metadata (deserialization):** Partial only — dangerous-code and taint analysis can flag unsafe parsing, but it does not sandbox deserialization.  
**AST06 — Weak Isolation:** Out of scope — a pre-install static/LLM scanner does not provide runtime sandboxing or process isolation.  
**AST07 — Update Drift:** Partial — re-scanning on update and OSV freshness help, but it does not pin versions or enforce an update policy.

### Known Limitations

- Pre-install analysis: catches issues before installation, not runtime behavior. Pair with sandboxing (AST06) and governance (AST09).
- The LLM semantic stage requires an API key / model provider; static-only mode (`--no-llm`) runs without one but with reduced intent coverage.
- Static pattern coverage, like any scanner, can be evaded by sufficiently novel obfuscation — use as one layer of a pipeline, not the sole gate.

### Framework Integration

CLI and Docker; scans Git repos, URLs, zip files, directories, or single files. Emits SARIF v2.1.0 for GitHub Code Scanning and other SARIF consumers, plus JSON and Markdown. Integrates into CI/CD as a pre-merge or pre-publish gate keyed on the risk score.
